# Admin-Dashboard-TOP  
Project created during The Odin Project course (TOP)  
The goal was to create a admin dashboard page. Something like on example below (in screenshots).  
It has to have a header, with searching form, buttons, user picture and some text. It should have also a sidebar with whole menu with icons.  
The main content was a box with cards - title of project, text and icons. On the right side of the page should be a navigation bar with some announcments and trending list. Of course whole in nice, fitting colors.  
Screenshots with my solutions:
